## Preparations

Before you can get started, you must make the necessary connections and observe the following important safety measures.

### Power Connection

- **Check mains voltage:**  
  The specification on the voltage selector next to the mains input must match your household mains voltage.

- **Connect to mains:**  
  Insert the power cable into a properly installed Schuko socket.

- **Protection:**  
  The power transformer is short-circuit protected by a **thermal fuse** and therefore requires no primary mains fuse.

Observe VDE regulations.  
Always unplug the power cable before opening the device.

**Note for cold weather:**  
Devices coming from cold environments fog up in warm rooms. This condensation is a normal physical process. Please wait until the device has fully dried before switching it on, as leakage currents could cause damage.

→ First acclimatize, then play.

### Audio Connection

The CX 5 has **two** types of audio connections.

#### Stereo Output (Sum)

Via the stereo jack socket **“Stereo Output”**:

- Two-channel summed signal  
- Connect:
  - Keyboard / organ amp  
  - Mixer stereo input  
  - Active loudspeakers  
  - High-impedance stereo headphones (> 800 Ω)

#### 8-Channel Studio Outputs

For use with a mixing console, **8 separate channels** are available via RCA connectors.

The 27 instruments of the CX 5 are distributed across the 8 channels:

| Channel | Instruments                                              |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Chan. 1 | Bass drums                                              |
| Chan. 2 | Snares                                                  |
| Chan. 3 | Hi-hats                                                 |
| Chan. 4 | Tom-toms, Timpani                                      |
| Chan. 5 | Cymbals                                                 |
| Chan. 6 | Bongos, Synthedrum                                      |
| Chan. 7 | Tambourine, Brush, Trill, Handclap, “Hey,” “Aha”        |
| Chan. 8 | Cowbell, Crash cymbal                                   |

No audio is available at the other connectors – they carry control signals (pads, sync, MIDI, etc.). These are explained in their respective chapters.

## Basic Configuration

![Front Panel – Basic Configuration](buttons.png)

### Switching On

Switch on the device using the **power switch** located on the back of the unit.

- All LEDs in the control panel buttons briefly blink as a **start check**.  
- The display shows: `DRUMCOMPOSER CX 5`.  
  (The basic hardware version may not have a display.)

**Note:** For reference, the control panel buttons are numbered from **top left = 1** to **bottom right = 35**.

### Selecting and Starting a Rhythm

1. Press any rhythm selection button **15**–**22** or **27**–**34**.  
   - The start check ends.  
   - The selected rhythm button LED and button **6 “F-RH 1”** (Fixed Rhythm Group 1) remain lit.  
   - The LED of **“START/STOP” (35)** blinks.

2. The display shows the rhythm name.

3. Start the rhythm by pressing **“START/STOP” (35)**.  
   - A play symbol (in some versions “*” or “▶”) lights up on the right side of the display.  
   - The left side shows the tempo in **beats per minute (bpm)**.  
   - Range: approx. **20–233 bpm** depending on software version.

4. Use the **“Speed”** slider to change tempo and the **“Volume”** slider to set overall volume.

The **“START/STOP”** button also blinks at the beginning of each bar (down-beat indicator).

### Changing Rhythms

To change the rhythm while stopped or running:

- Press another rhythm selection button **15**–**22** or **27**–**34**.  
- The new rhythm name appears immediately in the display.

### Selector

The **“Selector”** button (4) switches between the two fixed rhythm groups:

- Group 1: **F-RH 1** (button **6** inactive as selector)  
- Group 2: **F-RH 2** (button **6** active)

Each physical rhythm button then has **two rhythms**:

- Upper inscription: Group 1
- Lower inscription (or alternate version): Group 2

The names of the second rhythms are not printed on the buttons but are displayed on the alphanumeric display.

### Reset Function

Pressing the **red Reset switch on the back**:

- Immediately stops all functions  
- Returns the device to the defined **initial state** (start check)

Use this function whenever you have made an operating error and are unsure how to continue.

---

### Tempomat (Cruise Control)

The CX 5 provides a stored “ideal tempo” for each rhythm.

- Activate **“Tempomat” (9)** → LED lights:  
  - Every selected rhythm plays at its stored **standard tempo**.  
  - The **“Speed”** slider becomes inactive.

- Deactivate **Tempomat** (press again) → LED off:  
  - Tempo is again adjustable via **“Speed”**.

For user-programmed rhythms, you can define your own standard tempo (see section **Programming Standard Tempo**).

---

### Start/Stop / Intro/Break

Each programmed rhythm generally consists of **two different bars** that alternate.

- The **Down-Beat Indicator** (LED of “START/STOP”) marks the **first beat of each bar**.
- **“Start/Stop”** always starts the rhythm on the **“one”** of the first bar.

For each rhythm there is:

- An **Intro** (introduction)  
- A **Break** (solo / fill)

Operation:

- Tap **“Intro/Break” (23)** briefly while stopped:  
  - The intro plays for one bar, then the normal rhythm follows.

- While rhythm is running:
  - **Short tap (< 0.1 s):** triggers a one-bar break starting at the next bar.  
  - **Long press:** break starts immediately and continues as long as the button is held.

---

### Pitch

You can change the overall tuning (pitch) of all digital instruments.

1. Start the desired rhythm.  
2. Press **“Pitch” (8)** – LED lights; **“Speed”** slider now works as **pitch** control.  
3. Adjust pitch with the **“Speed”** slider.  
4. Press **“Pitch” (8)** again – LED off; **“Speed”** returns to tempo control.

The selected tuning applies globally to all rhythms until changed again.

- To return to normal tuning, repeat the procedure and set the “Speed” slider to its **center** position.  
- After power-off, the CX 5 automatically returns to **normal tuning**.

---

### Snare Roll

The **“Snare Roll”** function (button **14**) triggers a snare drum roll, even while a rhythm is running.

---

### Sound Effects

**Group 1:**

- Crash cymbal  
- Thriller  
- Clap  

**Group 2:**

- “Hey”  
- “Aha”  
- Synthe Drum  

Use **“Effect Sel.” (12)** to switch between the two groups.

(Internally this corresponds to two effect banks; the same buttons **24**–**26** trigger either *group 1* or *group 2*.)

---

### Manual Rhythm (Man. Rh.)

The **Manual Rhythm** mode allows you to trigger up to 16 instruments directly “by hand” when the rhythm engine is stopped.

- Press **“Man. Rh.” (13)** – LED lights:  
  - Rhythm buttons **15–22, 27–34** become **instrument triggers** (play the assigned instruments directly).

- Press **“Man. Rh.”** again – LED off:  
  - Manual mode is off; the previously selected rhythm is again ready to run.

You can also start the previously selected rhythm directly with **“START/STOP”** even if Manual Rhythm is still active – the rhythm will take over.

---

## Full Configuration

![Front Panel – Full Configuration](buttons.png)

### Timpani Mode

You can play **13 timpani** tuned in semitone steps from the panel:

1. Press **“2nd Function” (3)** – LED blinks.  
2. Press **“Timpani” (1)**.

- Press **“2nd Function”** again to exit Timpani mode.

---

### Programming Rhythms

You can program up to **32 own rhythms** into the free memory locations and later:

- Recall  
- Edit  
- Delete  
- Save to cassette or cartridge

(You can save the 32 rhythms to cassette or cartridge and read them back in to create your own rhythm archive; see [Cassette Save](#cassette-save) and [Write Cartridge (Wr. Cart.)](#write-cartridge-wr-cart)).

For programming, place the included **control panel mask** on the panel; it shows the alternate programming labels for the buttons.

![WERSI CX-5 Control panel mask](programming.png)

#### Selecting Storage Location

- Make sure **F-RH 1**, **F-RH 2**, and **Cart.** LEDs are **off** (you must be in the free RAM group).  
- Press any button **15–22 or 27–34** → 16 basic locations.  
- Use **“Selector”** to access a second location per button (total: **32** locations).

If a rhythm is already stored there, its name appears in the display.

- Press **“Program” (1)** twice (LED on).  
  - The display shows `BEATS TIMES`.

#### Entering Time Signature

1. Press **“Erase” (4)** – LED lights.  
   - Buttons **15**–**22** (upper row) now have numeric values **1**–**8**.

2. Define **beats per bar** and **subdivision (steps per beat)**:

   - **3/4 time:**  
     - Press **17** → value *3* (beats)  
     - Press **18** → value *4* (steps)

   - **4/4 time:**  
     - Press **18** twice → (*4* beats) × (*4* steps) = *16* sixteenth notes per bar  

   - **6/8 time:**  
     - Press **20** → value *6* (beats)  
     - Press **16** → value *2* (subdivision)

   - **5/4 time:**  
     - Press **19** → value *5* (beats)  
     - Subdivision = triplets (*3* steps) as per mask / documentation (e.g. button labeled **3** on *control panel mask*)

> **Note:** To enter a 4/4 time signature, press **18** twice (enter two 4s):
> the **first 4** sets the number of beats per bar, the **second 4** sets the subdivision (steps per beat).
>
> Applied to 4/4, each quarter note is divided into 4 sixteenth notes — **4 × 4 = 16** sixteenth notes per bar.

Conceptually:

- **Beats × Steps = total grid steps per bar**

Applied to our example of **4/4** time, each quarter note is divided into four sixteenth notes — **4 × 4 = 16** sixteenth notes per bar.

### Examples

- **4/4 — Entering 4/4**
   - Press **18** twice (enter two 4s): the **first 4** sets beats per bar, the **second 4** sets subdivision (steps per beat).
   - Result: **4 × 4 = 16** sixteenth notes per bar.
   ![4/4 Rhythm Grid](4x4.png)

- **6/8 — Entering 6/8**
   - Press **20** → value **6** (beats).
   - Press **16** → value **2** (subdivision / steps per beat).
   - Result: **6 × 2 = 12** sixteenth notes per bar.

- **5/4 — Entering 5/4 (Take Five feel)**
   - Press **19** → value **5** (beats).
   - Use subdivision **3** (triplet steps) to get the swing feel (press the panel mask button labeled **3**).
   - Result: **5 × 3 = 15** triplet steps per bar.

When finished, the display shows the new time signature and **“Erase”** (4) is no longer lit.

3. Press **“Pgm/Lev” (14)** – LED on → **Program** mode active.  
4. Press **“START/STOP”** to start the metronome (uses Rimshot).

## Sync to Tape / Sync from Tape

When using the 8-channel outputs of the CX 5 in professional **multi-track recordings**, you would normally occupy 8 tape tracks with drums.

Using **Sync to Tape / Sync from Tape**, you can instead:

- Record only a **tempo control signal** on one tape track.  
- Use the other tracks for other instruments.  
- Later, have the CX 5 play in **perfect sync** with the recorded material.

### Sync to Tape

Transfer the control (tempo) signal from CX 5 to a track of the multi-track recorder.

1. Connect CX 5 **“Sync to Tape”** output to one track input of the multi-track machine.  
2. Switch on both devices; arm the tape track for **record**.  
3. On CX 5:
   - Select rhythm or sequence and set desired tempo.  
   - Press **“Pad/Midi” (2)** – LED blinks.  
   - Press **“2nd Funct.” (3)** repeatedly until display shows `TX SYNC TO TAPE`.  
   - Press **“Pad/Midi” (2)** again – LED off; display shows `MSYST` (or similar).  
   - Set tempo exactly with the **“Speed”** slider – display shows e.g. `108 ST`  
     (108 = bpm, ST = Sync to Tape).

4. Start the tape recorder (recording).  
5. Start the CX 5 with **“START/STOP” (35)**.

The CX 5 now sends synchronization pulses to the multi-track tape.  
You may change the tempo during transfer; the variations are captured on tape and will later control the CX 5 accordingly.

When finished:

- Press **“START/STOP” (35)** to stop CX 5.  
- Stop the tape machine.

The sync signal is now stored on the tape.

### Sync from Tape

Use the previously recorded sync track to control the CX 5.

1. Rewind the tape to the start of the sync recording.  
2. Connect tape machine sync-track output to **“Sync from Tape”** input on CX 5.  
3. On CX 5:
   - Press **“Pad/Midi” (2)** once.  
   - Press **“2nd Funct.” (3)** repeatedly until display shows `RX SYN FROM TAPE`.  
   - Press **“Pad/Midi” (2)** once more.  
   - Display shows `TSY` (Tape Sync).

4. Start the tape machine in **play** (not record).

The sync signal from tape now automatically starts and controls the CX 5 in exact tempo and position.

**Checking Software Version (full configuration):**

---

### External Control via MIDI (Program Change / Rhythm Selection)

You can control rhythm selection and Intro/Break from an external instrument (organ/keyboard) that can send appropriate MIDI **Program Change** messages.

Requirements:

- CX 5 must be in **“Rec. Sync. MIDI”** mode (see 9.1.3).  
- **Receive channel 15** must be selected.

Behavior:

- CX 5 interprets **Program Change** messages on channel 15 as **rhythm key codes**.

Format (from original):

- Status byte: `11001110` (hex CE) – Program Change on channel 15  
- Data byte: `00xxxxxx` – key code 0–63

Mapping:

- Codes **0–15** → select rhythms 1–16 (upper row)  
- Codes **16**–**31** → also activate **Selector**, then treated as codes 0–15: result = rhythms *17*–*32*

---

### Summary CX 5 + MIDI (Technical Overview)

1. **Available MIDI Channels:**

   - MIDI **Transmitter** and **Receiver** of the CX 5 can each be assigned **independently** to any of the 16 MIDI channels.  
   - TX and RX can therefore operate on **different** channels.

2. **Operating Modes (Instruments):**

   a) **Receive Instrument Codes:**  
      - CX 5 receives MIDI Note On/Off and Velocity codes on the selected RX channel.  
      - Triggers corresponding percussion instruments with **8 volume levels**.  

   b) **Send Instrument Codes:**  
      - CX 5 sends MIDI notes and velocities based on its internal percussion playback (rhythms or pads) on the selected TX channel.  

   c) **Receive + Send Instrument Codes:**  
      - Combination of a) and b).

   d) **MIDI Through:**  
      - Received percussion note data is forwarded unchanged via MIDI Out, while also triggering CX 5 instruments.

   e) **Receive MIDI Real-Time Clock:**  
      - CX 5 responds to MIDI **Start (FA)**, **Clock (F8)**, **Stop (FC)** messages (independent of channel):  
        - `11111010` – hex FA – Start  
        - `11111000` – hex F8 – Clock (1/96 note)  
        - `11111100` – hex FC – Stop  

      - On RX channel 15, Program Change messages can additionally control rhythm selection, as described in 9.7.

   f) **Send MIDI Real-Time Clock:**  
      - CX 5 can send Start, Clock, and Stop messages to control other devices.
